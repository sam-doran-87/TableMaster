TableMaster is an open-source web app for managing tabletop RPG combat encounters and turn-based scenarios. It is intended to help Game Masters track everything from turn order to character status and hit points while progressing through turns.
The core feature is the Initiative Tracker, where the user inputs the names and initiative scores of each character in the encounter. This can be re-ordered by dragging and there is a button to sort by initiative, automatically slotting the characters
in the correct order based on their scores.

Click a character to highlight, or advance the turn, to populate a character sheet which includes Hit Points, Armor, Status, Modifiers, and Notes for the character.

This tool is meant to be 'system-agnostic' meaning its core functions can be used for any game system or rule set.

AI Disclosure:
This project is 'vibe coded' using Google Gemini, which has allowed me as a hobbyist and solo developer to create a tool that I've wanted for a long time, but didn't have the coding knowledge to make it happen. The layout and features are my own design,
and Gemini generates and debugs the code. I am aware that using AI in creativity is controversial, and I strive to use this technology in an ethical way, to the best of my abilities. I am releasing this project for free and open-source so that other gamers can use
and enjoy it, even expand on the tool to make it more useful for their own games.
